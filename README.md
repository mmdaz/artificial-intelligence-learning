  #### Chapter I : The machine learning landscape.
    An intuduction for Machine Learning : 
        Machine learning is the field of study that gives the computers
        the ability to learn without being explictly programmed.
    
    In fact we have a problem and training data and our machine learning programm
    learn from training data to solve and predict for new data.

    Machine learning is great for:
        * Problenms for each existing solutions reqiure long list of rules (spam email problem)
        * Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using traditional approach.
        * A ML system can adapt to new data.(Fluctuiting environments)
        * Getting insights from a big data.
